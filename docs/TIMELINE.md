# Development Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery & Design | Weeks 1-2 | Product spec, low/high-fidelity mockups, audio script drafts |
| Core Build | Weeks 3-6 | Workout engine, navigation, theming, offline data |
| API Integrations | Weeks 7-9 | Spotify SDK, ElevenLabs prompts, Firebase scaffolding |
| QA & Polish | Weeks 10-12 | Performance tuning, accessibility pass, App Store assets |

## Milestones
- **Week 2**: Approve design system + workout catalog.
- **Week 4**: First playable session with mocked audio.
- **Week 7**: ElevenLabs & Spotify integration behind feature flags.
- **Week 10**: Beta build distributed via TestFlight.
- **Week 12**: App Store submission package ready.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Audio Latency**: Pre-generate prompts and stream low-latency audio segments.
- **Spotify SDK Constraints**: Build custom dev client early; secure premium account for QA.
- **Battery Drain**: Optimize animation loops, pause background timers when app inactive.
